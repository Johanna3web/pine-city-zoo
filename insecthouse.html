                <h3>INSECT HOUSE</h3>

                <p>Welcome to the **Insect House**, a buzzing world full of creepy crawlies, fluttering wings, and fascinating facts! This immersive exhibit showcases the smallest yet most important creatures in the animal kingdom.</p>

                <p>Step into a lush, climate-controlled habitat filled with butterflies, beetles, ants, stick insects, and more. You'll be amazed by the colors, patterns, and behaviors of insects from around the globe. Interactive displays help you learn how these tiny creatures support ecosystems and why they are essential for pollination, soil health, and biodiversity.</p>

                <p>Kids love the hands-on exploration zone, where they can observe insects up close through magnifying domes and microscopes. Thereâ€™s even a live ant colony building tunnels in real time!</p>

                <p><strong>WHERE IS IT LOCATED?</strong></p>
                <p>The Insect House is nestled between the butterfly garden and the reptile house. Just follow the buzzing sounds!</p>
