                <h3>MONKEY TRAIL</h3>

                <p>Get ready for some fun and mischief on the **Monkey Trail** – home to some of the zoo’s most playful residents! This lush, elevated trail winds through treetop enclosures where monkeys swing, climb, and show off their acrobatic skills.</p>

                <p>The trail gives visitors a chance to observe different species of monkeys in a habitat designed to mimic their natural environment. From the tiny tamarins to the energetic capuchins, there's always something entertaining to see!</p>

                <p>Along the path, you'll find educational signs, shaded rest stops, and interactive stations where you can test your own monkey-like reflexes. Keep your eyes open – the monkeys love to surprise guests with their curious nature!</p>

                <p><strong>WHERE TO FIND IT?</strong></p>
                <p>The Monkey Trail begins just past the giraffe exhibit and loops around the eastern side of the zoo. Don’t forget your camera – this is a guest favorite!</p>
