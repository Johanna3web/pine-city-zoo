                <h3>LOST FOREST</h3>

                <p>Step into the enchanting **Lost Forest**, a hidden world filled with towering trees, exotic plants, and secret animal hideouts. It's a peaceful escape from the busy zoo paths and a paradise for nature lovers and curious explorers.</p>

                <p>As you walk along the winding trail, you might spot colorful birds, tree frogs, lizards, and even shy forest mammals. The forest is filled with natural sounds and dappled sunlight — creating the perfect environment to relax and reconnect with nature.</p>

                <p>Interactive signs and hidden QR codes along the trail offer fun facts about forest life and conservation efforts. Don’t miss the observation deck for a stunning view over the treetops!</p>

                <p><strong>WHERE TO FIND IT?</strong></p>
                <p>The Lost Forest entrance is tucked behind the Insect House and leads toward the western edge of the zoo. Look for the wooden archway covered in vines!</p>
