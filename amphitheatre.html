                <h3>AMPHITHEATRE</h3>
                <p>The Amphitheatre is one of the most exciting attractions in our zoo. Nestled in a lush, shaded area near pen E22, it offers a unique space where visitors can experience live animal shows, conservation talks, and interactive educational programs. It's a must-visit for families, students, and animal lovers alike.</p>

                <p>With comfortable seating and excellent acoustics, the amphitheatre hosts daily presentations that feature some of the zoo's most intelligent and charismatic animals. Trained zookeepers engage the audience with fun facts, conservation tips, and impressive demonstrations of animal behavior.</p>

                <p>Beyond entertainment, the amphitheatre serves an important role in spreading awareness about wildlife protection. Each session is crafted to inspire visitors to appreciate and support efforts to preserve our planet’s incredible biodiversity.</p>

                <p><strong>WHERE IS IT LOCATED?</strong></p>
                <p>The amphitheatre is located in the heart of the zoo, directly beside the elephant enclosure at pen E22. Check the event board at the entrance for the day’s showtimes!</p>
